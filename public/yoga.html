      <h3>What is yoga?</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">Yoga uses breathing techniques, exercise and meditation. ... Yoga is the Sanskrit word for union. Patanjali was a pioneer of classical yoga. He defined yoga as "the cessation of the modification of the mind" (stopping changing the mind). A person doing yoga will move from one posture (called asana) to another.</p>

        <h3>Ashtanga</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Whenever I meet someone and they ask me what I do, I’m always SO proud to tell them I’m an Ashtanga Yoga teacher. But 9 times out of 10 I’m met with blank faces and the question….”What is Ashtanga Yoga?”

          So it’s fair to say I’m pretty well-rehearsed in answering this question!
          
          Here’s all you need to know about my favourite style of yoga.
          
          “Ashtanga” means “eight limbs”
          In Sanskrit, the ancient language of India, the word “Ashtanga” means eight limbs.
          
          The term was first used by an ancient Indian sage called Patanjali, who wrote The Yoga Sutras; the authoritative text on yoga. He described eight practices (“limbs”) that we should master in order to transcend suffering and recognise our true nature.
          
          So Ashtanga Yoga is the practice of these eight limbs in order to experience the true goal of yoga.
          
          I won’t go into too much detail about all the limbs here (it would take waaaay too long!) but the eight limbs of yoga are:</p>
      </section>
    <ul>
      <li>Yamas (behavioural observances – things you SHOULD do)</li>
      <li>Niyamas (behavioural restraints – things you SHOULDN’T do</li>
      <li>Asana (practice of physical postures)</li>
      <li>Pranayama (practice of breathing techniques to control our life force energy)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- HATHA -->

  <div class="container main-doc ml-5" id="hatha">
    <main id="main-doc">
      <section>
          <h3>Hatha</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">What exactly Hatha yoga actually is hasn’t changed for thousands of years, however our thinking and perception of it certainly has. Language is a powerful thing, and in different cultures the same word can have a variety of definitions, throughout the evolution of yoga practice, the same word – Hatha – has come to mean different things too.  

            Popular thinking ‘in the West’ (an all-too-common expression now), is that Hatha yoga is about balancing the body and mind. With ‘ha’ representing the esoteric sun, and ‘tha’ the moon, and the practice of Hatha yoga aiming to join, yoke, or balance these two energies. 
            
            A yoga class described as ‘Hatha’ will typically involve a set of physical postures (yoga poses) and breathing techniques, practised more slowly and with more static posture holds than perhaps a Vinyasa flow or Ashtanga class.</p>

  <!-- VINYASA -->

  <div class="container main-doc ml-5" id="vinyasa">
    <main id="main-doc">
      <section>
          <h3>Vinyasa</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Vinyasa is a style of yoga characterized by stringing postures together so that you move from one to another, seamlessly, using breath.  Commonly referred to as “flow” yoga, it is sometimes confused with “power yoga“.

            Vinyasa classes offer a variety of postures and no two classes are ever alike.  The opposite would be “fixed forms” such as Bikram Yoga, which features the same 26 postures in every class, or Ashtanga which has the same sequence every time.
            
            The variable nature of Vinyasa Yoga helps to develop a more balanced body as well as prevent repetitive motion injuries that can happen if you are always doing the same thing every day.
            
            As a philosophy, Vinyasa recognizes the temporary nature of things.  We enter into a posture, are there for a while and then leave.
            
            While Vinyasa, or Vinyasa-Krama, dates back to the Vedic age—the earliest period of yoga thousands of years ago—it referred to a series, or sequence of steps, to make something sacred.
            
            The movement practice of Vinyasa is said to begin with T Krishnamacharya who has had the largest influence on how yoga, in general, is practiced today.
            
            Put all this together and Vinyasa, is a breath initiated practice, that connects every action of our life with the intention of moving towards what is sacred, or most important to us.</p>
